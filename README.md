# moving_mesh_radiative_transfer
## An accurate and fast moving mesh Discontinuous Galerkin package for solving the 1D isotropic transport equation for the purpose of coupling to rad-transfer problems
### Quick start guide
### Installation 
Download the file ``moving_mesh_radiative_transfer`` and open the file. 

Invoke python via ``python3 -i imports.py``.

The program will prompt the user to choose a problem type from the list `[transport','rad_transfer','s2_rad_transfer',
                                        'rad_transfer_thick','config']`. `transport` runs scattering transport problems with $c=1$



### Testing
before invoking python, run ``pytest`` in the top level folder.

### Solver

To solve the transport equation for a specific source, 

``
import moving_mesh_transport.solver
``

Running 

``
solver.run_plane_IC(uncollided = True, Moving = True)
``

Will read in parameters from moving_mesh_transport/congfig.yaml and run an infininte plane pulse source with a moving mesh and using the uncollided solution. Setting ``uncollided = False`` does not use the uncollided solution and ``moving = False`` solves the equations with a static mesh. (note: the plane pulse takes much longer to run compared to the other sources due to the higher number of discrete angles required to converge).

The commands,

``
solver.run_square_IC(uncollided = True, Moving = True)
``

``
solver.run_square_s(uncollided = True, Moving = True)
``

``
solver.run_gaussian_IC(uncollided = True, Moving = True)
``

``
solver.run_gaussian_s(uncollided = True, Moving = True)
``

``
solver.run_MMS(uncollided = False, Moving = True)
``

run a square pulse, a square source, a Gaussian pulse, a Gaussian source, and a MMS (Method of Manufactured Solutions) problem.
(note: there is only one case for the MMS source)

The command 
``
solver.run_all()
``
runs all cases for every source.
The terminal will print a `RMSE` vallue (root mean square error) compared with the benchmark solution. The order of convergence is displayed as `Order`. The run data (RMSE, computation time, number of spaces, number of angles) will be saved to run_data_RMS.h5, overwriting previous runs that had the same parameters. A plot will be created of the benchmark solution and the solutions returned by the solver. 

To interact with the plots produced by the solver,

``
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
``

run

``
plt.close()
``

to close the current plot.

### RMS Plotter

To visualize the accuracy of the results

``
from moving_mesh_transport.plots import make_plots
``

run 

``
make_plots.plot_all_rms_cells(tfinal, M)
``

To plot the results from running ``solver.run_all()`` where ``tfinal`` is the evaluation time and ``M`` is the number of basis functions. For the example case, choose ``tfinal = 1`` and `` M = 6``.

To plot a benchmark solutions, 

``
make_plots.plot_bench(tfinal, source_name, fign)
``

Where `source_name` can be `plane_IC`, `square_IC`, `square_source`, `gaussian_IC`, `gaussian_source`, or `MMS`.

### Benchmark maker

If you are interested in re-running the benchmark module (which takes quite a while)

``
from moving_mesh_transport.benchmarks import make_benchmarks
``

``
make_benchmarks.make_all()
``

will integrate the Greens function solution for the plane pulse and produce benchmark results for all of the sources run by the ``solver`` except for the MMS source at times 1, 5, and 10. For this reason, running the ``solver`` at other final times will return results but the benchmark solution will be 0 for all x. 

### Final notes
In ``config.yaml`` certain parameters may be easily changed, such as the final evaluation time, number of basis functions, number of cells in the mesh, and number of discrete angles. Please ensure that the lengths of the  `N_spaces`, `Ms`, and `N_angles` lists are all the same, or the program will complain.
